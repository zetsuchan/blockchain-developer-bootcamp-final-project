Crypto Idea

A 1v1 street fighter type game

- Each attribute as a LOOT type NFT
- NFTs can be packaged together to create “battle sets” equips or so
    - Maybe bundling/unbundling
- Character, Map can be bases, even maybe underlying maps all each stem to base cities or something
- Character is generated with some type of preset data
    - Eventually like ur astro signs etc input at mint
- Eventually have NFT art for the pixel characters
- “Battles” still have to think of a system to interact with the chain
    - But some type of “random” env where its a Rock Paper Scissors style interaction
    - This means that attributes and abilities need levels of power
- Battles generate a winner
    - Winner gets a “staked” amount of tokens users input to start battle
    - Lands can be big NFTs maybe, LP pools for each lands NFTs
    - Assuming this needs an ERC20 for this aspect, some high inflation or high supply token to make all this part of the system work
- Staking for ur land generates a bonus or something to that effect to incentivize more battles on X land
- Body attributes can have power levels too
    - Maybe attached to gradients of hair colors, accessories
